### Example Output


You're absolutely right! My apologies for skipping that. A project without a README is like a book without a cover. Let's fix that right now.

A good README is the front door to your project. It tells people what it is, why it's useful, and how they can use it. It's a critical professional habit.

Creating the README File
Create a new file named README.md in your github-scraper directory.

Copy and paste the following Markdown code into it. This template covers all the essential information.
